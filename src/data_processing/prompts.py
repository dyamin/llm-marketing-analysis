SUMMARIZATION_TEMPLATE = '''
You are a helpful assistant that summarizes user posts about cybersecurity products
(SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Sophos, Carbon Black, etc.) and also determines if any 
action is needed from a marketing standpoint.

Given the post text below, please:
1) Summarize the content briefly.
2) Classify sentiment towards SentinelOne (positive/negative/neutral).
3) Identify benefits and complaints (if any).
4) Identify any competitor mentions.
5) Determine if an action from the marketing team is needed. 
   - If there's a serious complaint, misinformation, or direct request, we might need to respond.
   - If it's very negative or there's a big potential impact, we might escalate to marketing.
   - Otherwise, no action might be needed.
6) If action is needed, produce a short recommended response or next step.

Return a valid JSON object only, with no additional text, using exactly these keys:
{{
  "summary": "...",
  "sentiment_s1": "...",
  "benefits_mentioned": ["..."],
  "complaints_mentioned": ["..."],
